Step-by-Step Explanation of the Encoding Process:
Character Analysis (analyze_character): For each character in the input string, the following steps are performed:

Alphabet Position: The position of the character in the alphabet is calculated (e.g., 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, ..., 'z' is 26). If the character is not a letter (e.g., a number or symbol), this value is set to 0.
ASCII Value: The ASCII value of the character is obtained using the ord() function. For example, the ASCII value of 'a' is 97.
Hexadecimal Representation: The ASCII value is converted to a hexadecimal string (e.g., 'a' becomes '0x61').
Binary Representation: The ASCII value is converted to an 8-bit binary string (e.g., 'a' becomes '01100001').
Is Lowercase: A flag indicating whether the character is lowercase (1 if true, 0 if false).
Is Uppercase: A flag indicating whether the character is uppercase (1 if true, 0 if false).
Is Alphabetic: A flag indicating whether the character is an alphabetic letter (1 if true, 0 if false).
Is Vowel: A flag indicating whether the character is a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'). 1 if true, 0 if false.
All of this information is concatenated into a single string for each character.

Analyze String (analyze_string):

This function processes the entire input string by calling analyze_character for each character and joining the results into one long string. Each character is represented by its encoded data.
Character Shifting (shift_characters):

After analyzing the string, each character in the encoded string (which is a string of data about each character) is shifted by 3 positions in the alphabet (if it is an alphabetic character). Non-alphabet characters (like numbers and symbols) remain unchanged.
The shifting is done by:
Converting each character to its ASCII value.
Adding the shift value (3), while ensuring the shift wraps around the alphabet (e.g., 'z' shifts to 'c').
Encode (encode):

First, the string is analyzed using analyze_string, which returns a detailed string representing the input characters' attributes.
Then, the analyzed string is shifted using shift_characters, producing the final encoded and shifted string.
Reverse Shift (reverse_shift):

To decode the string, the reverse shift function is applied, shifting characters back by 3 positions.
